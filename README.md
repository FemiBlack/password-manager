# Password Manager

> Simple password manager application built on [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/). I made this project for my personal use, consider use it at your own risk.

All my passwords are 16 characters long and randomly generated from A-Z, 0-9 and special characters included, so it's really hard to remember.

***(Note: This description is for previous version)*** I chose VueJS because it's easy to start, and with some basic knownledge when I've learned ReactJS, jump into VueJS is a big "WOW". I want to focus in VueJS, so I used the boilerplate [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) to generate. 
Documentation about the original structure can be found [here](https://simulatedgreg.gitbooks.io/electron-vue/content/index.html).

**Update:** In version 3, I rewrite the source code from scratch, project was generated by [Vue CLI 3](https://cli.vuejs.org/), then installed `electron-builder` as plugin. More information you can read [from here](https://github.com/nklayman/vue-cli-plugin-electron-builder).

## Credist
Big shout out for creator/maintainers of these packages that Password Manager relies on:
- [x] [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) for navigation.
- [x] [VeeValidate](https://baianat.github.io/vee-validate/) for input validation.
- [x] [Electron JSON database](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-json-storage) to store data. 

## Features
The application should have these features, but some of them are under development.
- [x] Add new record (each item is a row of password.)
- [x] Edit record.
- [x] Delete record.
- [x] Instant search.
- [x] Sort by alphabetical order.
- [x] Sort by frequent of clicks.

## Work in Progress
These are features I'm working on it:
- [ ] Encrypt password input.
- [ ] Setting: backup/restore data into secret Gist.

## Note!
In current situation, I made a simple "crypto" method to convert every character into new character, using your passphrase as "key". This is definitely not a proper way to store sensitive data so consider to use this app at your own risk.

## Build Setup
``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# run on development
yarn electron:serve

# build electron application for production
yarn electron:build

```

## Calling for HELP! 

I'm a graphic designer [(click to see my portfolio,)](https://www.behance.net/sangdth) but unlike many others, I never formally trained at a school. Instead, I learned my skills through observation, self-directed study and work experience from 2004.
